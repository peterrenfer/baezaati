                            <p>Is there an option in uTorrent (2.2.1) to keep a downloaded torrent active, as in constantly updating seeds/peers, but not having it actually seed something? You see, I let my seed behaviour depend on the type of torrent and how active it is at that moment. I like to give more of my upload speed to less known, less available torrents, because we all know the struggles when you find a torrent but it's near dead. As a result, torrents with +2 seed/peers ratio or +2 availability are usually üî•–°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å uTorrent ‚Äî –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–π —Ç–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç –∫–ª–∏–µ–Ω—Ç –ø—Ä–∏ –ø–æ–º–æ—â–∏ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ üöÄ —Å–∫–∞—á–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–µ —Ñ–∞–π–ª—ã –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–æ–π –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä, –∞ —Ç–∞–∫ –∂–µ –¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–µ–Ω—Ç–æ–º —Å –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è–º–∏ –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º–∏ —É—á–∞—Å—Ç–Ω–∏–∫–∞–º–∏ torrent. Megathread discourages uTorrent. Is there a downside to using the old version 2.2.1 today? Any reason to switch to qbit or other alternatives. uTorrent - –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–∞—è –ø–æ–º–æ–∂–µ—Ç —Å–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –ª—é–±—ã–µ —Ñ–∞–π–ª—ã –∏–∑ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç–∞ (–ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è, —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º—ã, –∏–≥—Ä—ã, –º—É–∑—ã–∫–∞). As a start, I do have a UPnP enabled router. There is a tab somewhere and it is checked. Yet I still can't host. Other than this, there is a tab called "Virtual Servers" and I'm guessing that it allows you to host stuffs, but, how am I supposed to put the numbers (20595) in?

Hi, I want in Jpopsuki. Lately, I've been tracking down certain artist that I can't seem to find on other sites. I have a demonoid account(haha) that had a good ratio count. But I hadn't used in ages and found out they took that out. My rules for torrenting is to double up on what I download. However sometimes if I do leave majority of them for ages. https://puu.sh/vH4Kt.png https://puu.sh/vH4NX.png I don't know if that'll help, but here is the statistic of my utorrent info and an example. –°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å —Ç–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—É uTorrent –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω—é—é –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏—é –Ω–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º —è–∑—ã–∫–µ –¥–ª—è Windows XP, 7, 10, 8 –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ –∏ —Ç–µ–ª–µ—Ñ–æ–Ω–∞ –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–æ–∏–¥, iPhone,iPad  –£–¥–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ uTorrent —Å –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ –ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é. –ö–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ —É–¥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ–≥—Ä–∞–º–º—É uTorrent —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –Ω–∞ –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–µ –Ω–µ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª–∏—Å—å –∑–∞–ø–∏—Å–∏ –∏ —Å–ª–µ–¥—ã Kind of an old timer here.

A serious security exploit has been found that can easily allow a remote attacker to steal passkeys, peer information, or even download things to the remote computer. AHD site and user security are paramount, so please switch to an alternate client in order to keep seeding. uTorrent 3.x will remain a disallowed client up until it has been provably patched and secured and staff are certain it no longer poses a security risk.

I have been downloading torrents for years this is the first problem I have ever had. I started to download a new tv show and I got the first part fine on kat.cr then when I tried to click any other torrent I got the Utorrent is not valid bencoding message. I was wondering if this means that they have specifically caught me or is this a blanket thing they are doing. I have TWC now switching to something new since the merger with Charter should I be worried. I don't really Hi fellow BT-Fans, I just recently got a QNAP TS-251, and have been trying to setup a good workflow for torrent downloads/seeding. The QNAP App is crap IMHO, and Transmission and QBittorrent are not working on my beta FW. So i got RTorrent, which seems to be pretty amazing. Countless advanced config option, good UI. Perfect for me. BUT: When i try to add torrents (By Magnet or Torrent file), all trackers are missing! Example: When i add this magnet link "magnet:?xt=urn:btih:!!!!CENSORDED Utorrent is super slow when it comes to downloading my shows these days. One episode of running man can take 'years'! I'm starting to think utorrent is the problem. What do you guys use? Any suggestions? Thanks. Here's the thing, I've switched from utorrent to Deluge but I really miss utorrent's feature. I can't select beforehand the files I want to download from a magnet link, something that I could do with utorrent. Is there a trick to enable this? Thanks. I store my music in flac format and I sometimes use XLD to transcode them to different audio formats. I use iTunes and I set XLD's output folder to iTune's automatically add folder. So I'd like to do 2 things: - Add/edit tags/album names of my flac files so I don't have to do this every time I transcode - Add an album artwork jpg/png in some/all album folder directories Will this interrupt torrent at all? I'm assuming by editing the tags of the flac files, I'll be seeding flac files I know not everyone supports apps like uTorrent here, and I understand your position. However, I'm seeking people knowledgeable about macs and uTorrent that might be able to help me run an ip filter. Directions for windows say I need to add the file ipfilter.dat to a folder %AppData% but I think those directions only work for Windows because no matter how hard I search I can't find directions or the folder on my mac. Any info or alternatives greatly appreciated. So I went to try and cross seed a torrent but when I tried to DL the second torrent my seedbox gave an error that it had the same infohash. Is it okay to just add the tracker to the original torrent with the second tracker or will this screw up ratio tracking. i double checked with PFPortChecker, with success. What am i missing. Is it safe? Should I use something like BTGuard to remain anonymous. Any particular client/site I should use. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 
Hulu doesn't have it, I don't really want to torrent it and most sites need you to register(download software, players etc). I love the show, but need to get caught.

Husband had a nasty porn addiction, went to treatment, and says he has been clean no m no p for 7 months now. He has no desktop comp and he has accountability software on his phone (truple) But In February he got a work phone and he said he was worried to put truple on it but said i could look at it whenever, and that he wasn‚Äôt going to use for personal stuff bc he didn‚Äôt want to get in trouble. This morning was the first time I looked- I‚Äôve had no reason to because I just thought Pirating was a whole new world to me around 4 months ago, I didnt even know that it WAS pirating. I thought it was almost too good to be true, I blindly disregarded any idea of VPNs when using Utorrent and today I have suddenly gotten a popup while browsing from Xfinity talking about data that they have in regards to me downloading copyrighted material. I genuinely am frightened by this as I had no idea that this was really a bad thing to do. I was blinded by the potential </p>
