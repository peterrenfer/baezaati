Hi All, I am trying to use an ELO1590L monitor with a Beckhoff CX9020 IPC. The specific version of the monitor is the PCAP version, E334335. In the documentation for the ELO monitor, it says that the driver must be included in the build of the Windows CE image. I've spoken to Beckhoff support, they really didnt have much info for me. A little bit of searching yields someone else who simply copied the DLL for the driver over and ran the registry edits. I have tried I'm relatively new to PoSh, so this is a bit advanced for me. I'd like to use a C# function in a DLL. C# Function: int EloGetDiagnosticsData(PSCREEN_PROPERTIES pData, UINT nScrNo) The PSCREEN\_PROPERTIES data type is defined as: typedef struct _SCREEN_PROPERTIES { int iWindowsMonNo ; ULONG Type; char Port 256 ; char SerialNumber 18 ; DWORD HardwareHandshaking ; CONTRL_STAT ctrl_status; LONG BaudRate; char crevminor;.

(https://www.reddit.com/r/emulation/comments/4ujf4i/what_can_i_do_emulationwise_with_a_mac_mini_ppc/) A year ago, I guess. And the help was appreciated. A lot of things happened in the intervening months that kept me from working on it, but now I have the thing nicely poised in my kitchen, on a swivel stand, with a touch-screen monitor (more on that in a sec), running TenFourFox, RetroArch. I picked up a nice 15 inch LCD touchscreen from my local used surplus junk store. connecting the display to my pi isn't an issue as i can use an HDMI to VGA Converter. What i would like to know is, if the touchscreen will work out if the box or if i need to install drivers for it to work. if so, then how can i Get the drivers. the Elo touchscreen site has generic linux drivers. would i try those first? also, has anyone written a pi compatible driver for this screen? Here's  How neat would it be to have a small lt12'' touch screen monitor on a night stand, under your computer desk monitor, or in the living room? Ports on the Display Dock Charging connectors: USB-C AV connectors: DisplayPort, HDMI Connector (max res 1920 x 1200) (HDCP 1.3 / 1.4 ) System connectors: DisplayPort over USB-C USB: 2 x USB 2.0, USB 2.0 high current charging port The hurdle here will be to ensure the display input is DispalyPort/HDMI, not USB. Some have USB graphics cards. I have a photo booth set up that originally used a Surface Pro with an Acer touch screen monitor docked via mini display port. All worked well until the Acer was dropped, cracking the screen. I decided to upgrade to an Elo touch monitor (Model 2094) thinking that it was better suited to commercial use due to its build quality. So far it has given me nothing but problems. The Acer was plug and play, just plug it in and everything worked perfectly. It used the Windows Touch service, so there. Just burned out an ELO touch screen monitor which is using WinXP to run communication hardware. Elo replacements range 0 - 0, while I ca pick up an Asus VT207N for 0. I went to the ASUS support site and they don't have drivers for XP. Amazon feedback shows some users said to use "plug and play" drivers but with this wort for the touch controls? Thanks for any help/advice. Howdy I recently purchased a piece of hardware that is running Windows 7e. Martin M2GO With a Planar PCT2485 multi-touch touchscreen I can get in to the command prompt from the Martin software, and from there I can open Explorer. My issue is that I can't use the multi-touch functions of the virtual console, IE bringing up multiple virtual faders at a time. Here's. 
Here's the touchmonitor I got: It's basically a touchscreen with no operating system. There are drivers for Windows, Mac OS and Linux. A friend won it at her work and she gave it to me. I just have no idea what I could do with it. If you have any idea, feel free to comment. It can be something useful, for the house, for a computer, or just something fun. I'm open to everything. Thanks. In case anyone was interested, or wanted to find some good,classic tunes, this list is the highlights of my Dad's life in music pretty much.

Here's the touchmonitor I got: It has no OS but I can plug into a computer. Drivers support Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. I have no idea what to build. Maybe something for the house? Or just something fun? I'm open to any suggestion, so feel free to comment. Thanks. Listen, I'm going to tell you some of the best pieces of advice I've ever learned in my life. First off: I'm not muscular etc, I hit gym sort of regularly but not much. I play videogames (And am actually fucking good, masters sc2 / 1900 elo LoL) I watch T.V. etc The advice? Nothing in this world comes for free, very VERY rarely does life work out like in the hollywood movies, THIS IS WHY THEY SELL SO MUCH, because shit like that never happens. You never see the emo depressed guy with no friend. So at work, we develop music video software. We just got a new batch of computers (Dell Optiplex 3020 Small Form Factor) and I'm curious about finding the capabilities of the DisplayPort out. Usually, we add an extra video card that has both VGA and HDMI or DVI out. The graphical interface for playing video goes out VGA and is usually connected to an ELO touch screen monitor. The video goes out one of the digital ports usually in 720p. Most of our clients (about 80%) use the DVI out, convertin. Here's the touchmonitor I got: I'm totally new to Raspberry Pi. There are Linux drivers available for the screen. What fun or useful thing could I build? Thanks. 
My dad gave me a functional lmv10r 10 inch resistive touchscreen monitor that was being decommissioned at work, and I am having no luck installing it on my windows 7 rig. it has a VGA and serial port, and although I can use it just fine as a generic non-pnp monitor at 800x600, I can't seem to get the touchscreen functionality to work. I know that my serial port works, since i've hooked up old serial mice to it before, but none of the drivers i find seem to work. I've tried elo touch monitor.
