Can someone give me clear instructions on how to dual boot the Android TV x86 iso found here (https://forum.xda-developers.com/general/device-reviews-and-information/android-tv-x86-t3726365) and install the 1.0 update for it with windows. 
I installed this Android TV ROM from this XDA thread (https://forum.xda-developers.com/general/device-reviews-and-information/android-tv-x86-t3726365) on my PC and I have two issues that I cannot figure out for the likes of me. The thread has been locked and the OP won't respond to my messages. SO I am hoping someone here can help me. I really would like this to work as this is a supposed to be a gift for a friend. Issue number one 1) I cannot get audio Hi, I have an MSI Cubi N and I want to make it a media center with possibility to control it with Google Home, as for Android TV. Is there a way to make it possibile? Such as installing Android TV x86 or maybe ChromiumOS. https://forum.xda-developers.com/general/device-reviews-and-information/android-tv-x86-t3726365 Gave it a try myself, and it does in fact work. I know someone did this about a year ago, but it didn't work for much. This version does allow Play store to work and download. Doesn't work for Netflix yet, and I haven't found an Amazon video APK for x86 either yet but still great to see someone making it work on PC hardware. BTW, unless I am mistaken, this requires I've recently been trying to make it run on an old laptop, and I have a few questions. First, how do I set it to run at 1080p? It's currently at a very blurry low resolution, and has significant screen tearing. Will it fully utilize intel HD graphics? Second, how well is it suited for a set-top-box type situation, where it will be operated via remote? I'm trying to make it into a streaming box for a TV. Is it possible to operate the onscreen keyboard with a remote, or should

Hi i have been using the app for Android TV. but seems that the Subtitles are not working, and the app itself crashes constantly. videos play quite well tho. the development versions are useless as i have tried all of them and none let me play anything, it only says "Play. I was reading this post but why! (https://www.reddit.com/r/htpc/comments/73beap/but_why/) and a few of the comments made me think about what exactly is a HTPC? With all of the new advances in technology and so many new devices. I am having a hard time defining what exactly is a HTPC. My traditional definition was a computer with and (intel/AMD CPU) Running Windows/Mac/Linux plug into a TV would count as a HTPC. Mostly because there really wasn't any other options.
